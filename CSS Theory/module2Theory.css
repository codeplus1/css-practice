/* Todo: Selector and Declarations */
/* ?Selectors: it determines which HTML elements the styles should be applied to. selectors can be based on element name, class name, IDs, attributes and more. */

/* ?Declaration: it consists of property-value pairs enclosed in curly braces "{}". Each declaration specify how a particular property should be styled (e.g., "Color:blue") */

/* Todo: Basic Types of CSS selectors */
/*
?Element Selector:
*It target specific HTML elements (e.g., p, h1, div, h2, h5, etc...) for styling

?class Selector:
*It target elements with a specific class attribute (e.g, '.highlight' , '.myclass', etc... ) to apply shared styles.

?ID selector:
*It target a unique element with specific ID attribute (e.g., '#header', '#saroj', etc..) for individual styling.

?Descendent Selector:
*It targets an element that is a descendant(i.e. child) of another element like <li> is the child of <ul>
*/

/* !Note: The main difference betwn ID and Class Selector is:
? Id selector can be Roll no of student which always should be unique in classroom. so we cant give same id to multiple elements.
!but
?class selector can be name of students where there is multiple students with the same name in classroom.so we can give same class name to multiple Elements.
