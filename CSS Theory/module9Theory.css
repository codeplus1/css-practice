?transition-duration
*- Specifies how long time it takes for a property to change during a transition from one state to another, in seconds or milliseconds.
?transition-timing-function
*- Defines how the values between the start and the end of the transition are calculated. default transition-timing-function: ease; The transition starts slowly, accelerates in the middle, and slows down at the end.

/*
!‚ö†Ô∏èTransition and Animation both are different things so don't Mix it up
*transition are only applied to the colors, background-colors, text, links, image etc...
!but
*animation is used to apply smoothness(like hover effects) inside text, background-color, images, links and etc..
