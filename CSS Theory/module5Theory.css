Todo: Box model and Layout
? "Everything in CSS is a Box"
*Any element in a webpage is a box. Go ahead and inspect any html element from a webpage, go to developer tools, and you will find a graphical represantion of selected box.

? 1. Box Model
* CSS box model is a way to understand how HTML elements are displayed on the web page. It consists of: content, margin, padding and border.
!A box is made up of 4 properties (i.e Content, Padding, Border, Margin)
- The width and height properties apply to the content area only.

?Margin
* Margin is the space outside of an element's box, it creates seperation between elements.

?Padding
* Padding is the space inside of an element’s box, between its content and its border.

?Border
* Border is a line that goes around an element. It can be drawn above or below the content.

?Content Area
* Content area is the actual content of the element.

Todo: Display Properties

?Display Properties
* The display property specifies how an element should be displayed on the page.
?Values for the display property
* block - This value displays an element as a block element (like p, h1, div).
* inline - This value displays an element as an inline element (like span, img, input).
* inline-block

!⚠️Block vs Inline inline-Block Elements
- Block elements always start on a new line.
- Inline elements do not start on a new line.
- Inline-block elements behave like inline elements, but they also use the vertical height property.
!final Conclusion ❤️
 ?inline
 *Inline element doesn’t start on a new line and only occupy just the width it requires. You can’t set the width or height.

?inline-block
 * inline-Block is formatted just like the inline element, where it doesn’t start on a new line. BUT, you can set width and height values.

 ?block
*The Block element will start on a new line and occupy the full width available. And you can set width and height values.

? 2. Layout
* In layout, we use CSS rules to position and arrange elements in relation to each other. This includes:
Todo: Positioning Elements
?position
* The position property allows you to specify where an element appears in the layout like absolute, relative, fixed, static, sticky.

?Static Position
*elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.

?Relative position
*An element with relative positioning is positioned relative to its current position.

?Absolute position
*An element with absolute positioning is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor or to the initial containing block if no positioned ancestors.

?Fixed position
*an element with fixed positioning is positioned relative to the viewport (the window).

?Sticky position
*an element with sticky positioning is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
